
THERE ARE 2 FOLDERS :
ONE IS APPLICATION FILE AND ANOTHER IS CODE FILE. IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE OR NEED CODE THEN SIMPLY CHECK SOURCE CODE FILE.
AND IF YOYU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME CLICK EXE GAME FILE AND RUN THE GAME..

WHILE CHANGING SOURCE CODES; THERE'S NO SOUND AND IMAGE FOLDER IN THAT FOLDER SO DO COPY IT FROM APPLICATION FOLDER AND USE IT!!
ENJOY!! ; )
